The design of the game is inspired by the underground in netflixes serie "Arcane", with vibrant colours and powerful characters.

The colors of the games are mostly based around green and purple for the overall feeling to get that arcane feeling. Other elemements and colors are used for contrast to that.

a recogniseble interface.

    - Startscreen that showss the logo of the game, and two choices to move to either player setup or how to play.
